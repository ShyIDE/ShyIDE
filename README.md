Hi my name is Shy or you can call me Brandon whichever you prefer. Curious with anything related to blockchain developement, cybersecurity, cloud and AI.
I am a computer engineer undergrad and cybersecurity enthusiast however currently trying to teach myself more on AI and cloud as I see it as the future.
I will be posting my self projects, and freelance work up here as a reference and if it intrigues anyone to learn from it that would also be an amazing +
For any business related queries or questions, please do contact me on twitter or discord above. See you in the future :D
